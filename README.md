# ModernStandard
The official Modern standard.
## Where is the standard?
Check out the branch for the version you're looking for.
## How standards work
New standards are created each 3 months.  
They release in March (for the .3), June (for the .6), September (for the .9) and December (for the .12)  
If you are making or using a compiler for production use, you should target the December versions (if not present, check for the latest version of the year.)  
The latest version is currently the ``2021.06``. The standards are considered finished when the month of the release ends.
