# The Operators
This file is all about operators.
## Arithmetic Operators
These are the arithmetic operators.
### Addition
Adds two numbers. Syntax:  
``val1 + val2``
### Subtraction
Subtracts two numbers. Syntax:  
``val1 - val2``
### Multiplication
Multiplies two numbers. Syntax:  
``val1 * val2``
### Division & Remainder
Divides two numbers. Syntax (get the quotient):  
``val1 / val2``
Syntax to get the remainder:  
``val1 % val2``
## Unary operators
These are the unary operators.
### Post-increment
Gets the number, then increments it. Works best with variables. Syntax:  
``val1++``
### Post-decrement
Gets the number, then decrements it. Works best with variables. Syntax:  
``val1--``
### Increment
Increments and gets the number. Works best with variables. Syntax:  
``++val1``
### Decrement
Decrements and gets the number. Works best with variables. Syntax:  
``--val1``
### Negative
Gets the negative value. Syntax:
``-val1``
### Not (logical)
Performs a logical not to a value. Syntax:  
``!val1``
### Not (bitwise)
Performs a bitwise not to a value. Syntax:
``~val1``
## Logic Operators
These are the logic operators.
### Equality
Checks if two numbers/data types (see MoreOperators.md) are equal. Syntax:  
``val1 == val2``
### Not equal
Checks if two numbers/data types (see MoreOperators.md) aren't equal. Syntax:  
``val1 != val2``
### Greater
Checks if a number is greater than another one. Syntax:  
``val1 > val2``
### Lower
Checks if a number is lower than another one.
``val1 < val2``
### Greater or equal
Checks if a number is greater or equal to another one. Syntax:  
``val1 <= val2``
### Lower or equal
Checks if a number is lower or equal to another one. Syntax:  
``val1 >= val2``
### And
Checks if two values are true (not equal to 0). Syntax:  
``val1 && val2``
### Or
Checks if one of two values is true (not equal to 0). Syntax:  
``val1 || val2``
